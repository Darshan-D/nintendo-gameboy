## Try out the app for yourself!
- This is just an MVP and not a production-ready app i.e. there are quite a few bugs!
- This is to showcase only the character movements and animations using flutter widgets i.e. this is not meant to be played as a game
- Available for Android 10+ : [Google Drive Link for APK file](https://shorturl.at/quBP1)
